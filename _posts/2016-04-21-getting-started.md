Getting started...

I first considered a blog or some sort of website with the name approaching40... I was 39, and approaching 40, but didn't really know if I wanted to commit to something so I checked online to see if it was available. It was. I still wasn't sure I wanted to do something like buy a domain name (I know, it costs next to nothing), so I called one of the popular companies to see how much it would be. I can't remember what it was but it wasn't much. My indecision however, led me to "think about it."

I think it was later that week, or the next, that I finally got around to just buying the domain. Well, I attempted to but it was already picked up by someone already. Huh. I guess that's just how some things work out.

A little while later, I turned 40 and decided for the same reason that I finally got around to deciding to buy the domain name "approaching40", I should just do it for "approaching50". I'd have a full decade to figure out what to write about it.

A year later, almost 2 actually, I've only gotten around to putting something up. This post has literally taken me months to get around to doing. This 1 post, after the issues of, "I don't have time to figure out WordPress", to let's try "The Grid", because it's AI for websites. Months have gone by since the beta release and here I am. No content, no direction.

I think I wanted to do the earlier one as some way to monetize getting in shape, but let's be honest - there's a lot of people out there good at that, and some of them far better at monetizing it than I'd ever be. 

There were the considerations of projecting and asking those questions about what it means to be a dad of 2 young boys; what it means to want to find a new career and what I actually want to do with my life - for the next 5 years at least. Basically the complete opposite of all the informative sites out there that tell you how to "hack your life", or how to be an entrepreneur and free yourself financially, what to eat, what to read and so on.

I'm still trying to figure that out, and after writing those things, they sound good, no? I mean who wouldn't to be an expert in something, and who doesn't want freedom?

Having said that, the universal questions of being a better man, a better husband and father, and finding not so much meaning in life, but meaning in the work I'm doing... those things remain.

Approaching50 is more about being 1/2 way there. Maybe that's being generous, but getting there, somewhere.
